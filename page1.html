This strategy is different from its predecessors because it represents a wider humanitarian reality and an organization that has grown in capabilities and stature. QRC's distinctive status enables it to work, collaborate, initiate and lead the way for improvement of the humanitarian situation worldwide.
<div>Saving Lives is what we strive for. Currently weak and vulnerable people all over the world lack access to the resources necessary to live in safety and peace. They live in fear, without security, health or livelihoods, because of natural disasters, conflict or widespread disease epidemics, leaving them feeling desperate and without hope.
</div><div>Preserved Dignity is crucial to our work. We aim always to instill and preserve the rights of those we work with, avoiding the marginalization of people based on social or economic differences. Our motto for the coming period forms the basis of our current and future work and reflects our vision of an ideal world: a world where the weak are secure, the strong are supportive and QRC 
</div><div>is at the forefront of making this happen. To examine our motto in more detail, this vision means that: firstly, the public will support the vulnerable in general and in particular those most able to do so, (whether organizations or individuals) in whatever way they can. The second part indicates the way QRC views itself; as a proud pioneer for humanity,  helping the strong defend the weak. This is what makes our strategy different; a 
</div><div>vision of a different reality and a different QRC, more focused in orientation. Nevertheless, this strategy remains within the framework of QRC’s mandate indicated in its statute, which we quote here: “To empower communities in the face of humanitarian crises and disasters and to protect their safety and dignity.” This is our mission in essence, the message we communicate to our communities and partners and to which we devote our efforts and resources. While following this path, QRC is determined to adhere to its values, which are an interpretation of the fundamental principles of the International Movement, and which reflect QRC’s performance and approach to  	Years19782018 humanitarian work.
